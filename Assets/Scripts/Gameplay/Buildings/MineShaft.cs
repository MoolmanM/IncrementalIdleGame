    // That will then be used to craft other stuff.
    // The refining process can maybe be done by a building.
    // Or just automatically when you want to build something.
    // Need to make resourcetypes to modify also an array for buildings. 
    // Because there will also be buildings in the future that will modify more than just one resource.
    // Need I also need to implement a resourcedecrementer like I did with workers. Because certain buildings such as the furnace, will decrement the 'energy' resource.
    // Then need to also start adding storage buildings, also buildings that accomplish misc stuff, such as make other stuff more effcient for example!
